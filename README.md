# SHUber-Taxi-Service
#### Databases and System Modelling Project on Level 4 at Sheffield Hallam Uni.
I worked on this project from Sep 2024 to Dec 2024

###### Case Study
*SHUber is a modern taxi service.
Users must download the app, signup and register their card details. 
Payments are handled automatically by the app. 
Customers can use the app to request a SHUber. 
Their current location is set as the pickup location, and they can manually set their dropoff location. 
A SHUber driver will accept the request and pickup the customer. 
The customer can see extra information about their driver, such as: name, profile picture, average rating, vehicle details and location on the map.
After the journey the customer recieves a summary of the route and their cost.
Drivers and customers have the option to rate eachother out of five.*

###### Project Brief
For the project, we were required to create: a use case diagram, a use case description, a UML class diagram, and entity relationship diagram, an extention of the current database and windows forms. **This GitHub Repo only contains the Database and Windows Forms**

###### My Project
My Project consists of Windows Forms. Users are able to see records of customers and drivers, the journeys taken by each customer, the vehicles of the SHUber drivers, and the payments made by customers.
The Windows Forms are connected to an SQLite Database. The Database was provided partially complete, and I needed to add information using the ERD I created.
The Windows Forms allow users to add, edit and delete information in the Database.
